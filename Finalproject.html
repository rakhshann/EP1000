                 <h2> Planning Stage</h2>

                 <table border="0px" solid black>
                 <th> My project will be a hat that the visually impaired people can use to navigate around simple areas. As of now, they'd be able to navigate around a room with walls etc. It will use an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstructions in the way and a vibration motor built into the cap will notify the user of the obstruction. </th>
                 </table>
                 <h4>SKETCH ON PAPER</h4>
                 <table>
                 <td><img src="images/drawing1.png" height="350px"></td> 
                 <td><img src="images/drawing2.png" height="350px"></td>     
                 </table>
                 <p> In these sketches, you can see how all the components will fit within the hat. You can also see in detail how the ultrasonic sensor casing will look as well as how the arduino NANO casing will look.</p> 
                 <p> As you can see, I plan to hid most of the wires within the cap by adding some holes on the hat. </p>
                 
                 <p></p>
                 <p></p>

                 <h4>CARDBOARD PROTOTYPE</h4>
                 <table border="0px" solid black>
                 <th> I made the prototype casings for the arduino NANO and the ultrasonic sensor with cardboard. I did so to be able to get accurate measurements for the 3D models that's needed for 3D printing and laser cutting. I did so to ensure that my parts will be able to fit in after fabricating it for the first time. This will allow me to not waste materials.</th>
                 </table>
                 <table>
                 <td><img src="images/cardboard1.png" height="350px"></td> 
                 <td><img src="images/cardboard2.png" height="350px"></td>     
                 </table>
                 <p> Here you can see how the ultrasonic sensor fits into the case. There are holes to allow the pins to be accessed as well as holes for the receiver and transmitter.</p> 
                 <p> In the other image, you can see how the arduino NANO fits into the case. There is a hole for the wires to exit the case, a hole for the USB, so that the code can be changed without removing the arduino NANO from the case. And lastly another hole for the 6 pins of the arduino to stick out. With the 6 pins sticking out, it allows the arduino to fit into a smaller case. I decided to make the case larger than the size of the arduino NANO so I would not have to damage the pins that I do not need for this project.</p>

                 <h4>ARDUINO CIRCUIT</h4>
                 <table border="0px" solid black> 
                 <th> Tinkercad did not have an arduino NANO, so I had to create the simulation using the arduino UNO instead. As you can see, I used a 9V battery, a vibration motor, a HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and a switch to turn the device on and off.</th>
                 </table>
                 <table>
                     <td><img src="images/arduino1.png" height="350px"></td> 
                     <td><img src="images/arduino2.png" height="350px"></td>     
                     </table>
                 <p> Here's the images of the circuit. I organised the wires nicely in order for the connections to be seen easily as well as for me to be able to have an easier time during the action creation of the circuit. </p> 
                 
                 <p></p>
                 <p></p>

                 <h4>BILL OF MATERIALS</h4>
                 <table border="0px" solid black> 
                 <th> Here's the summary for all the components I needed for this project.</th>
                 </table>

                 <p> This is the design for the case to house the ultrasonic sensor. There are holes to allow the transmiter and receiver to not be blocked. There is also another hole to ensure that the sensor's pins can be accessed.(Wires can also feel out of this hole). I have added the first 3 letters of my name in the 'bauhaus' font to the top of the casing.</p>
                </table>

                 <p>This is the design for the case to house the arduino NANO. There are holes to allow the wires to come out of it as well as holes to allow the usb to be plugged in without having to remove the arduino NANO.</p>
                </table>

                 <h2>FABRICATION STAGE</h2>
                 <h4> Laser cut</h4>
                 
                    <table>
                        <td><img src="images/laser1.png" height="350px"></td> 
                        <td><img src="images/laser2.png" height="350px"></td>     
                        </table>
                    <p> This the Arduino NANO case that I laser cut. I made it from a few pieces and glued them all together with super glue. As you can see, I have a pair of eyes on it so symbolise what my project is trying to accomplish, and ofcourse, the first 3 letters of my name in the 'bauhaus' font.</p> 
                 <p> </p>
                 <p> </p>
                 <h4> 3D Print</h4>
                 <table>
                    <td><img src="images/3d1.png" height="350px"></td> 
                    <td><img src="images/3d2.png" height="350px"></td>     
                    </table>
                 <p> This is the ultrasonic sensor case. I printed it with a brim in order to easily remove it from the build-plate. After that, I sanded the inside and the outside for the print to look smoother. Finally, I test fitted the ultrasonic sensor, so any resizing and printing can be done on the spot.</p>
                 <p> </p>
                 <p> </p>
